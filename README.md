# Visualizing Movie Flops

### Introduction
Visual exploration of film 'flops'. We define a box-office flop (or bomb) to be a film that doesn't make back its budget. Data manipulation was done using pandas in Python 3, visualization were created using ggplot and the python extension [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We were able to do this analysis using [The Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) off Kaggle by user Rounak Banik.
It is a common misconception that a film being 'bad' is the reason why it becomes a flop. We explored different factors such as genre, release year, and release month and found there are other factors which can drive a film to underperform.
